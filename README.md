# PremierLeague-Analysis
- Explored the importance of home field advantage in the Premier League using scores and fixtures data. 
- Created more columns derived from existing columns such as goal scored per game, goals conceded per game, team form, etc. 
- Additionally began developing a logistic regression model to predict results of upcoming fixtures. 

Possible Improvements: 
- Need to import more data to train and test logistic regression model
- Afterwards need to Cross Validate Model
- Create more features for logistic regression model
